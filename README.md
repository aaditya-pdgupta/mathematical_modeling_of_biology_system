# Introduction

Mathematical modelling is a process by which a real world problem is described by a mathematical formulation. This procedure is a kind of abstraction, that means, neither all details of single processes will be described nor all aspects concerning the problem will be included.

A main problem is to find an appropriate mathematical formulation. Then, for further studies of the model, common mathematical tools can be used or new ones are developed. Shortly, a model should be as simple as possible and detailed as necessary or vise versa. One mathematical formulation may be appropriate for several real-world problem, even from very different domains.

A great challenge of modelling is to bring together the abstract, mathematical formulation and concrete experimental data. The modelling process can be roughly described as follows.
