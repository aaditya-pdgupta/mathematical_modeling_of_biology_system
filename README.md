# Introduction

Mathematical modelling is a process by which a real world problem is described by a mathematical formulation. This procedure is a kind of abstraction, that means, neither all details of single processes will be described nor all aspects concerning the problem will be included.

A main problem is to find an appropriate mathematical formulation. Then, for further studies of the model, common mathematical tools can be used or new ones are developed. Shortly, a model should be as simple as possible and detailed as necessary or vise versa. One mathematical formulation may be appropriate for several real-world problem, even from very different domains.

A great challenge of modelling is to bring together the abstract, mathematical formulation and concrete experimental data. The modelling process can be roughly described as follows:

There are many different modelling approaches and their number is still increasing. We can not conclude all in our lecture. We are here to discuss about mathematical modeling in biological system. Mathematical modeling has been applied to biological systems for decades, but with respect to gene  expression, too few molecular components have been known to build useful, predictive models. New efforts have been greatly aided by much more extensive “parts lists” of DNA  sequences and proteins, as well as considerably enhanced computional power. As more biologists venture into systems-level studies, a general understanding of diverse modeling approaches related to gene expressions is necessary to facilitates close collaborations between experimentalists and modelers.
